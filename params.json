  "body": "Unicorn proposes to build significant communities of practice in digital delivery disciplines including:\r\n+ Agile project management & consulting\r\n+ Organisational design informed by holacratic and lean theory\r\n+ Talent development & leadership\r\n+ Development of 10X talent, ie. ‘Unicorns’\r\n\r\nWe upkeep and amplify our community engagement activities via:\r\n+ “Meet ups”\r\n+ Hack Days and weekend camps\r\n+ Classes in coding and other disciplines; both free-to-the public and commercially in business-to-business relationships\r\n\r\nUnicorn seeks to build its brand, recruitment and lead pipelines around these activities; and similarly lift the profile of the Melbourne tech-scene and the city’s perceived tech capabilities. Unicorn seeks to utilise these avenues to create a Common Ecosystem and maximise the ability of those engaged in it, to contribute to the development of an industry of high performance and collaboration, where 10X talent will seek to engage.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 and beyond, Unicorn expects to expand its business development function and thereby its client pool across industry, business size, and purpose — and continue to amplify its presence as a significant Melbourne-based development partner.",
